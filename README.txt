###DuckLife###

GENERAL:
DuckLife is a simple singleplayer-RPG.
As the name already expresses, the characters in
DuckLife are Ducks. 
The RPG-Genre of DuckLife should be kind of
medieval and survival.
My target is a simple game that is easy to play, 
thus, the world, the item system, the characters, etc.
shouldn't be too complex or detailed. Of course,
when a stable version is running completely independently,
there has to be space for improvement.
The graphics should also not be very high at the beginning, 
so that the game movement can be fast.
first: the system, later: the graphics
I use OpenGL as graphics engine.


ENGINE: OpenGL

CLASSES: The diagram in Classes.png describes the relation of
	the most classes in this repository. They are all the basis
	of a functioning game.
	The most important class is CGame.
	It contains the main loop, the render and the move method.
